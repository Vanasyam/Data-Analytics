Data Preprocessing and Visualization Mini Project
This mini project is part of my certification course in Data Analytics from Entri Elevate. It focuses on data preprocessing and visualization to derive meaningful insights from raw datasets.
Phase 1:
Performed data preprocessing using Microsoft Excel. This includes cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for analysis.
The processed dataset is being prepared for the next phase of visualization.
Phase 2:
Visualized the preprocessed data using Power BI to created an interactive and insightful dashboard.

This mini project aims to strengthen my skills in data handling, preparation, and visualization tools commonly used in data analytics workflows.
